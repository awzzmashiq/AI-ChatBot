Security Fix Cleanup Script
This script helps clean up the Google Drive authentication security vulnerability
where multiple users were sharing the same Google Drive account.

CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE FIXED:
- Previously: All users shared the same token.pickle file
- Now: Each user gets their own token file (token_username.pickle)
- Result: Complete user isolation for Google Drive access
